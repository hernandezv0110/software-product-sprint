      <h1>Victor Hernandez: Aspiring Software Engineer</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
      <p>
      I am an incoming third year at UC Irvine majoring in Computer Science. Im originally from Jalisco, Mexico
      but I moved to the United States when I was 2 years old. I have been residing in the bay area for most of my life
      and decided to move to SoCal for college. I want to create and make an impact in my community through technology.
      In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing soccer, investing, and learning how to cook new dishes.
